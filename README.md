The Access Control App for Tech Parks is an innovative mobile application designed to enhance security and streamline access management within tech park environments. Utilizing 
Kotlin and machine learning (ML) focusing on facial recognition technology, the app provides a robust solution for both employee and visitor access control. Employees are granted
access through facial recognition matching with an existing database, ensuring secure and efficient entry. Visitors must register via the app, specifying their purpose and the
employee they intend to visit. Upon arrival, the visitor's face is scanned, and the associated employee is notified to approve or disapprove the visit. Additionally, employees
can pre-register visitors for direct access on specified dates, with notifications sent upon their entry. This system also includes two-step verification of the visitors with
time-sensitive entry codes to enhance security. The app also features movement history tracking for both employees and visitors, offering a comprehensive overview of access
activities within the tech park.In addition to managing personal access, our app also handles vehicle entry. The app includes a feature for scanning visitors’ vehicle license
plates and allocating parking spaces in the visitors’ parking lot. This information is communicated to the visitor via the app, guiding them to their designated parking spot
and reducing congestion and confusion in the parking area. This app not only enhances security but also improves the overall user experience, making tech parks safer and more
manageable environments.
